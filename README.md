Why we want coding challenge?
==================================

We believe the best way to tell if you are an good engineer or not, is not from your CV, it should from your code.

That's why we would like to decide few interesting challenges to let you to code before you join.

Our hiring process usually like this:

1. If you are reading this page, probablly we already would like you to join us.
2. We expect you will spend 1-2 days to finish one of the [challenges](coding-challenge.md).
3. You will be invited to our office, demo, explain to our team members that you will work with together if you joined.


Readme
------
Write your README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. 
* Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
* Link to your resume or public profile.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

How we review
-------------

Your application will be reviewed by at least `one` of our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

**Demonstrate your skill set as much as possible** This challenge is NOT looking for functional. The goal is to show your skill set to us, let us know why do you do in this way, how do you approach the problem.

If you are strong at design pattern, please demonstrate in your code, so that we can understand how good it is.
If you care about security, please make a proper design so that we know what are the best practices for secruity.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:


Weight | Category | Description
--- | --- | ---
Medium | Architecture | How clean is the separation between the front-end and the back-end? Are choices of libraries, databases, tools etc. appropriate for the chosen application?
High | Communication | Does the README clearly and concisely explain the problem, solution, and areas for review? Are choices, remaining TODOs, and technical tradeoffs explored and explained? Was there clear communication and expectation setting with us during the process?
High | Code Quality | Is the code simple, easy to understand/extend, reuseable and maintainable? Would it pass a code review? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Is the coding style consistent with the language’s guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase? Is there good logging? Is it easy to debug?
V. High | Functionality | Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing? You will gain extra points if you go above and beyond in implementing additional helpful features. Think carefully about the intended user.
Low | Security | Are there any obvious vulnerability?
Medium | Testability  | How thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change? Are there some unit and some integration tests? We’re not looking for full coverage (given time constraints) but trying to get a feel for your testing skills.
Low | UX | Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the API intuitive?
Medium | Technical choices | Choose of libraries, databases, framework etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?

Bonus point (those items are optional):

* **Scalability**: will technical choices scale well? If not, is there a discussion of those choices in the README? 
* **Production-readiness**: does the code include monitoring? logging? proper error handling?
