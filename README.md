We are always looking for talent.

This challenge aims to:

- Test your coding skill
- Know how you think
- How to solve a problem


## Instructions
Implement the design from `page.jpg`. Pixel perfection is not the objective, but rather try to capture the look and feel. Find your own way of defining the different parts.


### Objectives

- Make it responsive
- Use semantic and accessible markup
- All files in the dist folder should be concatenated, minified or otherwise generally optimized

## Resources
Feel free to use the tools of your choice.

### Fonts (from Google fonts):
- Montserrat bold (Headings)
- Merriweather normal and normal italic

### Content
- Use any text content of your liking
- Feel free to use any images, but for your convenience all images are included in the repo

## Folder structure

Keep the root structure as this:

```
challenge
├── dist // <— Concatenated and minified files
├── index.html
├── [any build tool files needed]
└── src // <— Source files
```
