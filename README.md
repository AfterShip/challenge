# Mobile Engineer Coding Challenge

The objective is to create a iOS / Android mobile application by using AfterShip's API

The application should allow user to list ALL the shipments within their account, with:

1. Simple dashboard (show some charts data about the AfterShip account)
2. Infinite scroll to show all the shipments in one view
3. Anything you feel valuable to the user or you want to show your skill set by make use of AfterShip's API

## Requirements


1. Proper README must be provided
2. Please store the Screenshots of the apps as detail as possible in `Screenshots` folder in your repo 
3. Code in native: SWIFT for iOS / JAVA for Android
4. Unit test must be included
5. DO NOT fork this repo, must create a new github public repo for your work, so that commit history is retained. We also plan to opensource our iOS and Android mobile app that's why we prefer public repo
6. We value your time, and please don't spend more than 4 days to work on this challenge. You can put in README for the trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.


## Deliverable

Please send the github URL and built file to our email.

For Android, please compile and attached the APK file to the email.

Readme
------

Regardless of whether it's your own code or our coding challenge, write your README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses for Android or iOS
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. 
* Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
* Link to your resume or public profile.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.


## How we review
Your application will be reviewed by at least 1 of our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

* **Architecture**: how clean is the separation between the front-end and the back-end?
* **Clarity**: does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained?
* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Security**: are there any obvious vulnerability?
* **Testing**: how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change? Are there some unit and some integration tests?
	* We're not looking for full coverage (given time constraint) but just trying to get a feel for your testing skills.
* **UX**: is the app interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the API intuitive?
* **Technical choices**: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
* **Performance**: Any performance tuning? Any special handling?

## Bonus point (those items are optional):

* **Production Ready**: does the code include monitoring? logging? proper error handling?
* **Benchmark**:  How do you do the benchmark? Is it justify? fair?
